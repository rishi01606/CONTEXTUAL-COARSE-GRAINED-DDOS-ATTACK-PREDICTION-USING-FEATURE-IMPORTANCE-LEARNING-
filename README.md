Contextual Coarse-grained DDoS Attack Prediction using Feature Importance Learning


Welcome to the repository for the Contextual Coarse-grained DDoS Attack Prediction using Feature Importance Learning project. This project aims to leverage advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to effectively identify and mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, ensuring robust network security in contemporary sustainable environments.
Overview
DDoS assaults involve overwhelming a target system with a massive volume of requests or traffic from multiple sources, disrupting the normal flow of traffic to the targeted server, service, or network. Distinguishing between malicious and legitimate traffic is a significant challenge. This project addresses this challenge using a novel approach that combines two powerful deep learning models: the Deep Stacked Autoencoder and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, optimized through the Gradient Hybrid Leader Optimization (GHLBO) technique.
Features
•	Deep Stacked Autoencoder: Utilizes deep learning for efficient anomaly detection in network traffic.
•	Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: Structures units to cooperate in discovering long-term correlations within traffic sequences, enhancing the detection accuracy for DDoS attacks.
•	Gradient Hybrid Leader Optimization (GHLBO): An advanced optimization technique to enhance the learning process and performance of the deep learning models.
•	Real-Time Traffic Analysis: Capable of analyzing and classifying live network traffic as valid or malicious, ensuring timely threat detection and response.
Key Components
•	Machine Learning: Utilizes conventional and cutting-edge machine learning techniques to adapt to evolving security needs and attack patterns.
•	Network Security: Focuses on protecting network integrity by identifying and mitigating potential threats from DDoS attacks.
•	Optimization: Employs GHLBO to fine-tune model parameters for optimal performance in threat detection.
